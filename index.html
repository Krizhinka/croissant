    <h1>🥐 Croissant</h1>


    <p>
        A croissant is a buttery, flaky, viennoiserie pastry of Austrian origin,
        named for its historical crescent shape.
        Croissants and other viennoiserie
        are made of a layered yeast-leavened dough.

        The Austrian pastry known as a Kipferl is the croissant's ancestor—in the 1830s, an Austrian opened a Viennese
        bakery in
        Paris, which became extremely popular and inspired French versions of the Kipferi, eventually named the
        croissant.
